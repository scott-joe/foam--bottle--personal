What if Foam simply managed your various knowledge stores? If it was a subdir without .git on itself, but on it's subdirectories? Then it could manage and map infinite stores of information that you could simply clone in and wire up to extend your network. You could even publish specific sub-stores and access them all together, but they'd version separately. Perhaps add some auto "push to wherever this needs to go" functionality.

Add another `bottle` with some command like `foam add bottle ______` to add it to the set of managed projects if we're using some sort of repository of bottles like Homebrew.
