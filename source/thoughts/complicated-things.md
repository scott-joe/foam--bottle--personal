# Complicated Things

The thing about making complicated things is that it's always going to be complicated. You can make it simpler to the user, but it's always going to be complicated somewhere. Nothing about mechanics or entropy allows it to get simpler the more complicated it is. And the simpler you make it to the user, the more control they have to be willing to hand over to the one doing the simplifying.
