- Show how others track you, help people understand what the language is of their surveilance (what does Telemtry mean?).

## Reader

- Gemini style text documents with additional payload information about the document outline, size, author, publish date, copyright, etc.
- Any open source e-reader could arrive at this page, save it (be it article or book), and track it the way you would anything else. DRM-free documents. Pay for the book, lend the book. When you lend the book, you no longer have access until they return it. You can request the book back using the app/email. They can in turn share it as well, but it requires permission from the original person first. Can original purchaser revoke access? Metadata would include purchaser and current viewer.
- Make this process as similar to the physical book expereince as possible. Except your notes are kept with your device, not with the content. Those notes are overlaid onto the content when it's back in your control.
- Hifi tech, lofi delivery. E-Ink preferred receipents -> audio capable.
- Most of the features of Pocket, but without ads. I don't need to support an enormous dev team. I just want to funnel my content back into something I'd enjoy reading it on. Operates as a lofi content source with built-in text-to-speech

## Editor / Writing

- Add Grammarly support for writing
- Add other features like the AI shortening/summary development.
- Swap between WISIWIG editor for notes and full text editor with preview for serious creations.
- Publish to gemini for reading in Gemini-like browser and CapsuleReader. Publish HTML version to the Web.
